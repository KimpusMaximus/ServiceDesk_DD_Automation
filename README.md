# ServiceDesk_DD_Automation

First Python script to use in the office.

This script automates a OKTA login , checks the weather and checks SA covid Stats for our beloved service desk agents who need to login all the time.

You can check the weather with it and also the latest Western Cape Covid Stats!

Make sure that before you run this script that you have:

python 3.9 installed ,

and that you have installed the chrome webdriver , and

You have installed Selenium:

Windows:

\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Scripts>pip.exe install selenium


Mac & Linux Debian distros :

pip install selenium

Linux Debaian/Ubuntu:

Keep in mind you can automate this entire environment setup with python/bash but that will tyyake all the fun out of this challenge if i gave you that as wel ;)

So good luck!

Have fun!
and stay safe

this is the menu you get when you successfully run the code :)
