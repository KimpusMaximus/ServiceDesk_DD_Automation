# ServiceDesk_DD_Automation

This script automates a OKTA login , checks the weather and checks SA covid Stats for our beloved service desk agents who need to login all the time.

You can check the weather with it and also the latest Western Cape Covid Stats!

Make sure that before you run this script that you have python 3.9 installed and that you have installed the chrome webdriver!

Have fun!
